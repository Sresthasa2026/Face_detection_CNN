first of all u have to run the code collect_data at spyder or google colab(better to use cuz it will show so much things to download at local so better to use those from cloud).
then u have to give path of haarcascade classifier.xml file from that environment  at the left corner the files have to be uploaded first or direct path from file explorer. the open the IP webcam app installed in your phone by going to start server and give the correct IP address at url ..then run that file
while running u have to keep your phone in front your's and other friends' face with clear bg..i.e no other people and the server will automatically take the pictures...make sure the network connections of your phone and PC are same ...otherwise it'll give error
then name the folder names according to ur friendds's names...then run consolidated file..it will crrate 2 files i.e images and labels..
then u have to run all the codes of face_detection_project i.e importing all the libraries and and standardization..a nd detection and saving them to drive
if giving error in detection make sure ur accuracy is good enough whose code is in face_detection_project i.e to increase u may increase the size of epoch
